# My Profile

Name: Joshua Britton.

Student Number:S3814227

Email Address:S3814227@student.rmit.edu.au

I am a 26 year old male, I am a Australian Resident who speaks fleunt english. The highest education I have completed is Year 12 but i am currently studying a bachelors degree in Information Technology. I have always worked in retail from a young age and have been a manager for 7 years. I have recently been diagnosed with a rare auto immune disorder called nero-mylitis optica (NMO) which caused me to wake up one day paralyzed from the chest down because I had 2 lesions on my spine which squashed the nerves in my spine. I have been very lucky to make a 80% recovery so far and able to walk again.

My main interest in IT is website design and app creation. I have always loved the idea of making something that could change someones life. But I am also intrested in game programming. Just because of the hardwork that goes into making a video game and the evolution of graphics and code over the years.

I guess my intrest in IT started at a young age, I was always raised around some sort of tehnology that I had daily interaction which ranged from playing on my first ever console a Sega Megadrive to doing my homework on the family computer.

The event that really peaked my intrest in IT was in year 8 when I was able to actually participate in a IT class where I could do something fromm making a basic website with hyperlinks to a top down 8 bit game in game maker.

I choose to come to study at RMIT as it is online and because of constant appoitments it is alot easier to study online yo get my degree.
By the end of my studies I hope to be prepared enough to join the workforce in the career path I have chosen and to hopefull know enough to actually create my app idea as it is something very important to me.

# Ideal Job.

https://www.seek.com.au/job/39820645?searchrequesttoken=adaa6bb1-93c4-4af8-978a-a495d31148a4&type=standard This would be my dream job. I have choosen this job because I have always enjoyed looking into the creative side of IT and as I have worked as a Manager for 7 years I have already been able to work on my interpersonal skills.This job is definetly something I would have to work towards and not something i could step straight into as i dont have much programming knowledge yet and I would have to start at the bottom of the ladder. I think learning this dgree will really help me get my foot in the door. Also as a bonus at the bottom of the application says free coffee, And that is definetly the quickest way to my heart.

# Personal Profile.

My result in the Myers-Briggs test was INTJ. This was actually a hard conclusion to come to because when it comes to the first letter I found that I was both sides depending on my mood and what the situation called for at the time. The same could be said for the last letter as I can show qualities on both sides of that aswell.

For the learning quiz I just got the results from the learning quiz we did on the RMIT website when we first enrol to study. For this my result was the Dynamo. Sumed up I feel like it is almost the same answer as the first quiz we did just for a diffrent thing. As the first test was about my personality which will directly feed into the way that I study.

For the last quiz I did a personality quiz. The results that i got for that werent to surprising as I thought they were going to be. They basically cemented what everyone already has told me and that is I am confident in myself and my ability to complete something myself, And the second result I got from the test is that I am very achievment driven which has always been shown in the amount of effort i have always put into my work and the expectations that I put into myself.

All of these tests results honestly dont surprise me to much. I have spent alot of time focusing on becoming the person that I am today. Which is exactly what the results have given me.

I think these results will effect me in  a group because I can be quiet but I will want the best out of the assignment and will want to help everyone get to that, That could effect the project because I will always be wanting to make everything a close to perfect as I can.

I think when forming a group I should account for that by having a couple of stronger leader typr personalitys in the group that will be able to pull me back into line and tell me when good enough is good enough.

# Project Idea:

Overview:
My project I want to make is a health app for people in  wheelchair. Because you are confined to a wheelchair if you dont excersise you can gain weight which can lead to other health issues. Not only that but it actually takes alot of stamina and strength to get around in a chair by yourself with no assistance.

Motorvation:
My motorvation for this project is because I  was in a wheelchair for a small portion of time, And it really opened my eyes to a whole new world.  I want this app to be readily avalible to people that are in a wheelchair and people that arent so sure on how to improve their health and to help carers and loved ones be there and support the person.

Decription:
I want to make a app that is readily avalible to everyone but is directed to people that have gone through a incidcent that has left them in a wheelchair. I want this app to have a few diffrent things to help. By having diffrent excersices programs for people in chairs to do. Mainly because its not something you think about until it happens and then you dont really have a clue what to do.
From there I would like to improve the app in diffrent aspects to showing other everyday aspects that you have to learn i.e. Transfering to diffrent surfaces, Assembling and dissassembling your wheelchair, Cleaning and taking care of your wheelchair. To then also making a area for carers and loved ones so they can learn. 
Could expand from there to meals because its been shown that a diet can help more then the excersise.

Tools and Technology:
A computer with the correct programming applications.

Skills Required:
The ability to code in a language that apps will understand.
A physiotherapist/Personal Trainer for excersises.
Occupational Therapsit to show the correct way for transfers and other day to day tasks.
Nutrionist/Chef.
Basic Knowledge of how to use a wheel chair and the limitations that can come with that.

Outcome:
I hope the outcome of this App to help raise awareness to people. Not only that but help people in a wheelchair live a more full and healthy life.
