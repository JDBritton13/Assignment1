I am a 26 year old male, I am a Australian Resident who speaks fleunt english. The highest education I have completed is Year 12 but i am currently studying a bachelors degree in Information Technology. I have always worked in retail from a young age and have been a manager for 7 years. I have recently been diagnosed with a rare auto immune disorder called nero-mylitis optica (NMO) which caused me to wake up one day paralyzed from the chest down because I had 2 lesions on my spine which squashed the nerves in my spine. I have been very lucky to make a 80% recovery so far and able to walk again.

My main interest in IT is website design and app creation. I have always loved the idea of making something that could change someones life. But I am also intrested in game programming. Just because of the hardwork that goes into making a video game and the evolution of graphics and code over the years.

I guess my intrest in IT started at a young age, I was always raised around some sort of tehnology that I had daily interaction which ranged from playing on my first ever console a Sega Megadrive to doing my homework on the family computer.

The event that really peaked my intrest in IT was in year 8 when I was able to actually participate in a IT class where I could do something fromm making a basic website with hyperlinks to a top down 8 bit game in game maker.

I choose to come to study at RMIT as it is online and because of constant appoitments it is alot easier to study online yo get my degree.
By the end of my studies I hope to be prepared enough to join the workforce in the career path I have chosen and to hopefull know enough to actually create my app idea as it is something very important to me.

# Personal Profile.

My result in the Myers-Briggs test was INTJ. This was actually a hard conclusion to come to because when it comes to the first letter I found that I was both sides depending on my mood and what the situation called for at the time. The same could be said for the last letter as I can show qualities on both sides of that aswell.

For the learning quiz I just got the results from the learning quiz we did on the RMIT website when we first enrol to study. For this my result was the Dynamo. Sumed down I feel like it is almost the same answer as the first quiz we did just for a diffrent thing. As the first test was about my personality which will directly feed into the way thatI study.
