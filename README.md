Name: Joshua Britton.   

  

Student Number:S3814227

I am a 26 year old male, I am a Australian Resident who speaks fluent English. The highest education I have completed is Year 12 but I am currently studying a bachelors degree in Information Technology. I have always worked in retail from a young age and have been a manager for 7 years. I have recently been diagnosed with a rare auto-immune disorder called neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) which caused me to wake up one day paralyzed from the chest down. I had 2 lesions on my spine which squashed the nerves in those locations in my spine. I have been very lucky to make a 80% recovery so far and able to walk again. 

  

My main interest in IT is website design and app creation. I have always loved the idea of making something that could change someone's life. But I am also interested in game programming. Just because of the hard work that goes into making a video game and the evolution of graphics and code over the years. 

  

I guess my interest in IT started at a young age, I was always raised around some sort of technology that I had daily interaction which ranged from playing on my first ever console a Sega MegaDrive to doing my homework on the family computer. 

  

The event that really peaked my interest in IT was in year 8 when I was able to actually participate in a IT class where I could do something from making a basic website with hyperlinks to a top down 8 bit game in game maker. 

  

I choose to come to study at RMIT as it is online and because of constant appointments it is a lot easier to study online to get my degree. 

By the end of my studies I hope to be prepared enough to join the workforce in the career path I have chosen and to hopeful know enough to create my app idea as it is something very important to me. 

  

# Ideal Job. 

  

https://www.seek.com.au/job/39820645?searchrequesttoken=adaa6bb1-93c4-4af8-978a-a495d31148a4&type=standard This would be my dream job. I have chosen this job because I have always enjoyed looking into the creative side of IT and as I have worked as a Manager for 7 years, I have already been able to work on my interpersonal skills. This job is definitely something I would have to work towards and not something i could step straight into as I don't have much programming knowledge yet and I would have to start at an intern level and work my way up from there. I think acquiring my bachelor's degree in Information Technology will really help me. Also, as a bonus at the bottom of the application says free coffee, and that this is the quickest way to my heart. 

  

# Personal Profile. 

  

My result in the Myers-Briggs test was INTJ. This was actually a hard conclusion to come to because when it comes to the first letter, I found that I was both sides depending on my mood and what the situation called for at the time. The same could be said for the last letter as I can show qualities on both sides of that as well. 

  

For the learning quiz I just got the results from the learning quiz we did on the RMIT website when we first enrol to study. For this my result was the Dynamo. Summed up I feel like it is almost the same answer as the first quiz we did just for a different thing. As the first test was about my personality which will directly feed into the way that I study. 

  

For the last quiz I did a personality quiz. The results that i got for that weren't too surprising as I thought they were going to be. They basically cemented what everyone already has told me and that is I am confident in myself and my ability to complete something myself, And the second result I got from the test is that I am very achievement driven which has always been shown in the amount of effort i have always put into my work and the expectations that I put into myself. 

  

All these tests results honestly donâ€™t surprise me too much. I have spent a lot of time focusing on becoming the person that I am today. Which is exactly what the results have given me. 

  

I think these results will affect me in  a group because I can be quiet but I will want the best out of the assignment and will want to help everyone get to that, That could affect the project because I will always be wanting to make everything a close to perfect as I can. 

  

I think when forming a group, I should account for that by having a couple of stronger leader type personality's in the group that will be able to pull me back into line and tell me when good enough is good enough. 

  

# Project Idea: 

  

Overview: 

My project I want to make is a health app for people in wheelchair. Because you are confined to a wheelchair if you don't exercise you can gain weight which can lead to other health issues. Not only that but it actually takes a lot of stamina and strength to get around in a wheelchair and complete day to day tasks by yourself with no assistance. 

  

Motorvation: 

My Motorvation for this project is because my eyes were opened as I was confided to a wheelchair for a small portion of time, It showed me whole new world and how different day to day tasks were that you take for granted. I hope to be able to make this app and will be happy knowing that I have helped improved at least one persons life. 

  

Description: 

I want to make a app that is readily available to everyone but is directed to people that have gone through a incident that has left them in a wheelchair. I want this app to have a few different things to help. By having different exercises programs for people in chairs to do. Mainly because its not something you think about until it happens and then you don't really have a clue what to do. 

From there I would like to improve the app in different aspects to showing other everyday aspects that you have to learn i.e. Transferring to different surfaces, Assembling and disassembling your wheelchair, Cleaning and taking care of your wheelchair. To then also making a area for carers and loved ones so they can learn. Once i have a small group of people I would also love to be able to help them get in contact with other wheelchair users to help give tips or tricks to help each other. 

  

Tools and Technology: 

A computer with the correct programming applications. 
A program to create the application. 
A graphic design program to help create logo and app fonts. 


Skills Required: 

The ability to code in a language that apps will understand. 
A physiotherapist/Personal Trainer for exercises. 
Occupational Therapist to show the correct way for transfers and other day to day tasks. 
Nutrionist/Chef. 
Basic Knowledge of how to use a wheelchair and the limitations that can come with that. 
Graphic Designer. 

Outcome: 

I hope the outcome of this App to help raise awareness to people. Not only that but help people in a wheelchair live a more full and healthy life.
